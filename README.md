# Sentiment-Analysis-using-CNN-LSTM-LSTM-CNN-Hybrid-Models


This project focuses on sentiment analysis of English texts using Word2Vec embeddings and hybrid deep learning models (CNNâ†’LSTM and LSTMâ†’CNN). The dataset was preprocessed with careful tokenization, stopword removal, and word vector training using Gensim. Two deep neural networks were implemented to compare the performance of different architectures. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices on a test set.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
- Custom Word2Vec Embeddings (Trained on dataset)
- CNNâ†’LSTM and LSTMâ†’CNN hybrid model architectures
- Text preprocessing for Persian language
- Visualization of performance and confusion matrix
